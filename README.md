## Ideas

* What if you played minigames during the day that allowed you to improve various stats that prevented decreases in various virtues?
	* Increasing your own understanding of a value heightens the connection you build with your inner self
	* Penalties for aligning with Strength over Wisdom for Wisdom-focused characters are decreased with strong Wisdom
	* These mini-games can be self-management tasks--shower, shave, brush teeth
	* You have limited energy, preventing you from being able to tackle any of those tasks
	* You increase your available daily energy by getting a better relationship with your psyche
